Hello! My name is Umar and I love artificial intelligence.
Once upon a time, there was a small robot who learned to talk.
The robot said hello to everyone and made new friends.
I enjoy coding and building machine learning models.
Artificial intelligence is transforming the world today.
Robots can help humans with many different tasks.
Programming requires patience and problem-solving skills.
The future of technology looks very exciting.
